        <h2>Interface</h2>
        <li><p>The interface is based on direct manipulation â€“ it is directly controlled by touching the screen. The touches themselves correspond to real-life actions, such as dragging and tapping, through which objects on the screen and the virtual keyboard are manipulated. The interface is designed to respond immediately to user tasks. Available hardware, such as an accelerometer, gyroscope, and proximity sensor, is used by some applications in response to additional user actions. For example, changing the screen orientation from portrait to landscape mode depending on how the device is oriented.</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>When turned on, devices load a home screen similar to the desktop on personal computers. The home screen is made up of icons and widgets. Icons open their associated applications, while widgets are more for displaying real-time information, such as the weather forecast. The home screen can be composed of several pages that the user can swipe through. Most manufacturers personalize the way their Android versions look to differentiate themselves from competitors.</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>At the top of the screen is the status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity, such as signal strength or mobile data. The status bar can be pulled down to reveal the notification bar, where applications display important information or updates, such as receiving an SMS or email. Notifications are shown until you read them by double-tapping them or dismissing them by swiping them off the screen.</p></li>
        <br>
    </ul>

        <h2>Memory Management</h2>
        <li><p>Android devices are powered by batteries, so their system is designed to minimize power usage, unlike desktop operating systems that have a constant connection to an external power source. When an application stops being used for an extended period, the system automatically clears the memory it used. On the other hand, for applications that are closed for a short period, the system reduces power and memory usage by running the application in the background. This is a great convenience as it means you don't have to open the application from the beginning if you closed it and need its previous state.</p></li>
        <br>
        <img src="32_Android_Assistant.jpg">
        <li><p>Android manages memory automatically and very efficiently. When there are too many applications requiring additional memory, the system stops those that have not been used for a while, starting with the oldest. This process is not visible to the user to avoid the need for them to deal with stopping applications and clearing occupied memory.</p></li>
